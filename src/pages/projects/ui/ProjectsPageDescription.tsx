        I&#39;ve worked on a range of projects over the years, and these are some of my personal
        favorites. They&#39;re open-source, so if something sparks your interest, youâ€™re welcome to
        check out the code or even jump in and help improve it. Always happy to see fellow devs get
        involved!
